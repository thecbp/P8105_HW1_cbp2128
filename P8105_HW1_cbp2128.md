Problem 1
=========

Problem 1 reviews data types in R and type coercion. We'd like to create a data frame with columns containing one of the various types in R. Thanks to vectorization, we can base most of the other columns on the uniformly distributed numbers.

``` r
# Extract df length for change later
desired_col_length = 10

various_types_df = tibble(
  uniform_nums = runif(desired_col_length, min = 0, max = 5),
  is_gt_2 = uniform_nums > 2,
  characters = character(desired_col_length),
  factors = factor(is_gt_2, labels = c("NOT GT2", "GT2"))
)
```

Type coercion is the conversion of one type to another. In cases where you attempt to do some operation, say taking the average, on a data type that is incompatible with that operation, R will try to switch the types and salvage the situation for you.

Here, I would expect `mean()` to work on the uniform sample and the boolean values. Usually, programming languages will interpret `TRUE` as 1 and `FALSE` as 0, so taking the average here will make sense.

Conversely, it will not work for the character vector or the factor vector because it doesn't make sense to average out a string or category.

``` r
df_means = apply(various_types_df, 2, mean)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(newX[, i], ...): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
df_means
```

    ## uniform_nums      is_gt_2   characters      factors 
    ##           NA           NA           NA           NA

### Reminders for coding in R

-   meaningful variable / object names
-   readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and indentation; etc)
-   clearly-written text to explain code and results
-   a lack of superfluous code (e.g. no unused variables are defined)
