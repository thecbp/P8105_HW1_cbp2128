Problem 1
=========

Problem 1 reviews data types in R and type coercion. We'd like to create a data frame with columns containing one of the various types in R. Thanks to vectorization, we can base most of the other columns on the uniformly distributed numbers.

``` r
# Extract df length for change later
desired_col_length = 10

various_types_df = tibble(
  uniform_nums = runif(desired_col_length, min = 0, max = 5),
  is_gt_2 = uniform_nums > 2,
  characters = character(desired_col_length),
  factors = factor(is_gt_2, labels = c("NOT GT2", "GT2"))
)
```

Type coercion is the conversion of one type to another. In cases where you attempt to do some operation, say taking the average, on a data type that is incompatible with that operation, R will try to switch the types and salvage the situation for you.

Here, I would expect `mean()` to work on the uniform sample and the boolean values. Usually, programming languages will interpret `TRUE` as 1 and `FALSE` as 0, so taking the average here will make sense.

Conversely, it will not work for the character vector or the factor vector because it doesn't make sense to average out a string or category.

``` r
means_df = tibble(
  uniform_mean = mean(various_types_df$uniform_nums),
  logicals_mean = mean(various_types_df$is_gt_2),
  char_mean = mean(various_types_df$characters),
  factor_mean = mean(various_types_df$factors)
)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(various_types_df$characters): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(various_types_df$factors): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

``` r
means_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 4
    ##   uniform_mean logicals_mean char_mean factor_mean
    ##          <dbl>         <dbl>     <dbl>       <dbl>
    ## 1         2.76           0.6        NA          NA

``` r
# Expected to work


# Not expected to work
```

### Reminders for coding in R

-   meaningful variable / object names
-   readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and indentation; etc)
-   clearly-written text to explain code and results
-   a lack of superfluous code (e.g. no unused variables are defined)
